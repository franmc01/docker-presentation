# What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.

- 🚢 **Containerization**: Package your application and its dependencies together.
- 📦 **Consistent Environments**: Maintain consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
- ⚙️ **DevOps & CI/CD**: Streamline DevOps practices with containerized pipelines.
- 📈 **Scalability**: Easily scale applications up and down.
- 🔄 **Isolation**: Separate your applications to avoid conflict and manage dependencies effectively.
- 🛠 **Portability**: Run your containers on any machine without the "works on my machine" issue.
- 🤹 **Interactive**: Embed Docker commands and their output within your slides.
- 🎥 **Visualization**: Use Docker's dashboard to monitor container performance in real-time.
