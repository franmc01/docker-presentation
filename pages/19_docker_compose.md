# What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose simplifies managing multi-container Docker applications. With a single command, create and start all services from your `docker-compose.yml` file, making both development and deployment workflows more efficient.

## Key Features

- **Single-file service definition**: Organize your application's services, networks, and volumes in one file.
- **One-command setup**: Start your entire application stack with `docker-compose up`.
- **Easy cleanup**: Remove all components with `docker-compose down`.

# Docker Compose: Basic Concepts

Master Docker Compose's building blocks to orchestrate applications with ease.

- **Services**: Components like web servers and databases.
- **Networks**: Communication channels between containers.
- **Volumes**: Persistent or shared data management.

These concepts enable the design and operation of complex applications.

# Docker Compose: Expanded Use Cases

Docker Compose facilitates:

- **Local development**: Simulate production environments seamlessly.
- **Automated testing**: Run tests in consistent, containerized environments.
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate the build and test phases of applications.
- **Multi-service apps**: Coordinate the launch and interaction of services like front-ends, back-ends, and databases.
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quickly stand up and tear down complex app stacks.

Harness Docker Compose for efficient multi-container orchestration.

# Docker Compose Real Example: Part 1

Setting up our Vue.js application within a Docker container.

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  vue-app:
    build:
      context: ./vue-app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    container_name: vue-app-container
    networks:
      - tt-network-compose
```

This part of our `docker-compose.yml` focuses on building and running the Vue app, exposing it on port 5000.

# Docker Compose Real Example: Part 2

Continuing with our NestJS app and custom network setup.

```yaml
services:
  nest-app:
    build:
      context: ./nest-app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5001:3000"
    container_name: nest-app-container
    networks:
      - tt-network-compose

networks:
  tt-network-compose:
    name: tt-network-compose
    driver: bridge
```

Here we add our NestJS app to the Docker Compose configuration, exposing it on port 5001, and define the `tt-network-compose` network.
