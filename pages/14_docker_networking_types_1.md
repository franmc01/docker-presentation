# Docker Networking Types - Part 1

Docker provides various network types, each tailored for different needs, enhancing container communication and isolation.

### Bridge Network

- **Default network** when you run a container without specifying a network.
- Containers can communicate with each other while isolated from the host network.
- Use cases: Most applications needing communication between containers.


## Host Network

- Removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host, sharing the hostâ€™s networking namespace.
- Use cases: High-performance requirements where containers need to avoid network overhead.
