# Comprehending Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using a Dockerfile is the most common method for creating a Docker container.

## Why Use a Dockerfile?

- **Automation**: Automate the image creation process, making it reproducible and consistent.
- **Version Control**: Track changes in your Docker environment in a way that‚Äôs transparent and maintainable.
- **Customization**: Customize and share images according to your application's specific needs.

## Key Commands

- Build: `docker build -t <tag> .`
- History: `docker history <image>`
- Image Building: `docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -`

# Dockerfile Fundamentals

The Dockerfile defines the steps to create an image:

- **FROM**: Base image to start the build.
- **RUN**: Execute commands.
- **COPY/ADD**: Add files from local to the image.
- **EXPOSE**: Ports to expose.
- **CMD**: Default command at runtime.

Simple, yet powerful commands to package your application.

# Advanced Dockerfile Instructions

To refine image creation:

- **ENV**: Set environment variables.
- **ARG**: Arguments for building images.
- **ENTRYPOINT**: Configure a container that will run as an executable.
- **USER**: Set the user name or UID.
- **WORKDIR**: Set the working directory.

More tools for a fine-tuned Docker experience.

# Simple Dockerfile Example for a Web Application

Let's look at a basic Dockerfile for a Node.js web app.

```bash {all|1-2|3-4}
# Start with the official Node image
FROM node:18

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install app dependencies by copying
# package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Bind to port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

```

# Advanced Dockerfile for a NestJS App (Part 1)

Focus on setting up the environment and installing dependencies.

```bash {all|1-2|4-5|7}
# Node.js alpine image for a lightweight container
FROM node:16-alpine

# Set environment for production
ENV NODE_ENV=production PORT=3000

# Define working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install NestJS CLI globally
RUN npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production
```

# Advanced Dockerfile for a NestJS App (Part 2)

Continuing from the dependency installation, we set up the application.

```bash {all|1-3|5}
# Copy the rest of the application's source code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE $PORT

# Command to run the NestJS application
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
