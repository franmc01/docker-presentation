# Understanding Docker Images

Docker images are the basis of containers. They contain the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run.

## Why Docker Images?

- **Immutability**: Images are immutable, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Reusability**: Images can be used as a base for other images, promoting modularity.
- **Efficiency**: Layers in images can be shared, reducing space usage and speeding up builds.

## Key Commands

- Pull: `docker pull <image_name>`
- Build: `docker build -t <tag> .`
- List: `docker images`
- Remove: `docker rmi <image_name>`

# Docker Images: Best Practices and Tips

To get the most out of Docker images, it's essential to follow best practices and leverage tips for optimization.

## Best Practices:

- **Keep Images Small**: Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- **Use Tags**: Specify tags for easier image management and to avoid confusion.
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Reduce the size of your production images by using multi-stage builds.

## Tips:

- Regularly update your images to include security patches.
- Use official images as your base images when possible to ensure reliability.
- Optimize layer caching by ordering Dockerfile commands properly.
