# Understanding Docker Networking

Docker networking enables containers to communicate both internally and with the outside world, essential for most applications.

## Why Use Docker Networks?

- **Isolation**: Separately manage traffic between containers.
- **Communication**: Facilitate container-to-container and container-to-outside communication.
- **Customization**: Tailor network settings to meet specific application needs.

## Key Commands

- Create: `docker network create <name>`
- List: `docker network ls`
- Inspect: `docker network inspect <name>`
- Remove: `docker network rm <name>`
